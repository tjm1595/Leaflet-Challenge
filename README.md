# Leaflet-Challenge

The is challenge was coded in VS Studio using JS, HTML, and CSS. Each file was created in one folder in VS Code to make the calls to each file straight forward and easy for the HTML code to run without issues. 

The Part 1 folder houses each file used in this assignment. 
  The logic file is the JavaScript File.  
  The config file is used to store the API Key.
  The html file is the HTML file for the project. 
  Finally, the style file is our CSS file. 

The Images folder is a basic folder that houses images of the created website.
  There is a PDF File that contains a couple of images of this website.
